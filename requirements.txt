# MS-SLR: Motion-Signature Sign Language Recognition
# Python dependencies for real-time sign language recognition system
# Tested on Python 3.8-3.11

# Core dependencies
opencv-python>=4.8.0        # Computer vision and video processing
mediapipe>=0.10.0           # Hand landmark detection
numpy>=1.24.0               # Numerical operations and array processing
scikit-learn>=1.3.0         # Machine learning (ExtraTreesClassifier)

# Audio and speech
pyttsx3>=2.90               # Text-to-speech synthesis

# Optional: AI grammar correction (requires API key)
google-generativeai>=0.3.0  # Google Gemini API for grammar correction

# Development/Training dependencies (optional for inference-only deployment)
# pandas>=2.0.0             # Data processing during training
